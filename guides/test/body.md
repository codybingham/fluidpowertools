- From Hiram: "FYI, Customer requested that the bottom blade of the celery harvester be able to run up to 50% faster than its current range. Pump is currently running under 1000 psi so I gave Ben the go ahead to try a smaller motor. Gave him part number 601753 to try which is a 100cc in place of the current 165cc. Just wanted you to be in the loop. I recommend making a note to update that before the next build unless we run into problems with this change in the field."
- [ ] Update blade motor to 601753 #eventually #celery
